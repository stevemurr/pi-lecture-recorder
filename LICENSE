    Software License for The Fraunhofer FDK AAC Codec Library for Android

    © Copyright  1995 - 2013 Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft zur Förderung der angewandten Forschung e.V.
      All rights reserved.

     1.    INTRODUCTION
    The Fraunhofer FDK AAC Codec Library for Android ("FDK AAC Codec") is software that implements
    the MPEG Advanced Audio Coding ("AAC") encoding and decoding scheme for digital audio.
    This FDK AAC Codec software is intended to be used on a wide variety of Android devices.

    AAC's HE-AAC and HE-AAC v2 versions are regarded as today's most efficient general perceptual
    audio codecs. AAC-ELD is considered the best-performing full-bandwidth communications codec by
    independent studies and is widely deployed. AAC has been standardized by ISO and IEC as part
    of the MPEG specifications.

    Patent licenses for necessary patent claims for the FDK AAC Codec (including those of Fraunhofer)
    may be obtained through Via Licensing (www.vialicensing.com) or through the respective patent owners
    individually for the purpose of encoding or decoding bit streams in products that are compliant with
    the ISO/IEC MPEG audio standards. Please note that most manufacturers of Android devices already license
    these patent claims through Via Licensing or directly from the patent owners, and therefore FDK AAC Codec
    software may already be covered under those patent licenses when it is used for those licensed purposes only.

    Commercially-licensed AAC software libraries, including floating-point versions with enhanced sound quality,
    are also available from Fraunhofer. Users are encouraged to check the Fraunhofer website for additional
    applications information and documentation.
