####This package consists of three useful parts.

```remote.py``` which handles incoming IR signals via the lirc service.

```rec/watch.py``` which watches for new mp4 files after a lecture has been recorded and uploads it to google drive.

```./picam ``` which launches the picam module by ```https://github.com/iizukanao/picam```
